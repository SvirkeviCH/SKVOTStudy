            We work with the term <i>“Soft Minimalism”</i>, which basically is an investigation into what creates a product, interior or overall feeling, that holds the basic needs but a warm richness in the use of materials and details. This creates a higher tactility within a concept, and it’s our belief that this, in turn, brings it closer to the human body and therefore a longer lasting relationship between the two. This is the starting point for all our projects.
